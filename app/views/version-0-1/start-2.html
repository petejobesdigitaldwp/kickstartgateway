          <p>Use this tool to find a Kickstart gateway that may be able to support you in applying for a Kickstart Scheme grant.</p>
          <p>You may be looking for support with different things, for example in a specific area or sector. You can contact more than one organisation to see which one can best support your needs.</p>
          <p>These organisations have told the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) that theyâ€™re interested in helping employers. The list will be continually updated.</p>
          <p>DWP have checked these organisations using the Cabinet Office Spotlight Tool. Partnering with one of these organisations does not guarantee that you will get Kickstart Scheme funding.</p>
