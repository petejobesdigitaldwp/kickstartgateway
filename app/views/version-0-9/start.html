          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>gather information from you about the job placements you’d like to offer</li>
            <li>use this information to submit an online application on behalf of a group of employers</li>
            <li>pass on the relevant payments made by DWP to you (for example the young person’s salary)</li>
          </ul>

            <li>share their expertise with you to help you onboard and train young people employed through the scheme, for example supporting those with particular disadvantages or working in certain sectors</li>
